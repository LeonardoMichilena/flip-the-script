We are Stephanie, Leticia, Leonardo and Luciana, a team of four motivated and engaged participants of TechLabs Berlin. We started Flip The Script because we recognized an issue in the way society sees gender. The way language works in our conscious and subconscious mind is often underestimated, and so is the way it affects how we perceive gender.</br>
Flip The Script is aimed to be used as a tool for change and education about our language use by offering users the option to consciously decide for a fairer language. Furthermore, we want to offer visitors the option to learn more about language use and patters and why it is important. You can find, on the statistics page, our results from collecting and analyzing news articles from various sources across the web.</br>
