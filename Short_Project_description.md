We started Flip The Script because we recognized an issue in the way society sees gender. The way language works in our conscious and subconscious mind is often underestimated, and so is the way it affects how we perceive gender.</br>
Flip The Script is aimed to be used as a tool for change and education about our language use by offering users the option to consciously decide for a fairer language. Furthermore, we want to offer visitors the option to learn more about language use and patters and why it is important. </br>
We offer a text translater which will alter the submitted text in two different ways. One, the user can flip the text based on the gender binary. Two, the user can flip the text to gender neutral language. In addition, users can view a data visualization of the results from collecting and analyzing news articles from various sources across the web.</br>
Our technologies include Axios, Express, Flask, Notion, Figma, Dribble, Anaconda, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-lean, Streamlit. </br>
Our team consisted one from each of the following: data scientist, user exerpience/interface designer, front-end developer, back-end developer.
