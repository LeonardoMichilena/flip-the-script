# What is Flip The Script all about?
</br>
We started Flip The Script because we recognized an issue in the way society sees gender. The way language works in our conscious and subconscious mind is often underestimated, and so is the way it affects how we perceive gender.</br>
</br>
Flip The Script is aimed to be used as a tool for change and education about our language use by offering users the option to consciously decide for a fairer language. Furthermore, we want to offer visitors the option to learn more about language use and patters and why it is important. </br>
</br>
The main functionality is a translator which alters the submitted text in two different ways:</br>

1. Flips the text based on the gender binary standards.

2. Flips the text to gender neutral language.

In the "Statistics" section, users can check different data visualizations of the results from collecting and analyzing news articles from various sources across the web.</br>
We also added an extra functionality called "Predictor". That uses that same data analysis and implements a machine learning algorithm to predict how biased an article will be.</br>
