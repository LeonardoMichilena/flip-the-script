Text_converter / flip-the-script.py (Beta Version)

1. In case of using sample text from sample_text.csv, please use it with all quotation marks. Otherwise, Python will not recognize the sample text.

2. For other kinds of text, please check if the text contains quotation marks in it. If this is the case, you should use double quotation marks at the 
beginning and at the end of your text as per REGex logic.

3. Still working on a function to replace gendered nouns with neutral nouns.

4. Waiting for more data in order to increase vocabs in the list.
