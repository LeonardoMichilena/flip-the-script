# Introduction 
</br>

We are Stephanie, Leticia, Leonardo and Luciana, a team of four motivated and engaged participants of TechLabs Berlin. We started Flip The Script because we recognized an issue in the way society sees gender. The way language works in our conscious and subconscious mind is often underestimated, and so is the way it affects how we perceive gender. 

Flip The Script is aimed to be used as a tool for change and education about our language use by offering users the option to consciously decide for a fairer language. Furthermore, we want to offer visitors the option to learn more about language use and patters and why it is important. You can find, on the statistics page, our results from collecting and analyzing news articles from various sources across the web.

The MVP that we are presenting is a web app that essentially takes a user submitted text and flips the pronouns in the text to either the opposite gender's pronouns, or to gender neutral pronouns. While this is a centering topic of our MVP, it is not the only feature that our app provides. We have several different processes that make up our app, including a machine learning module, an analysis of data we collected over the duration of the project phase, and special design features. 

Here, you will find a deep dive into the process of building the app, the challenges we faced, and an explanation about the deliverable we created.
